Regular schedule + time = exponential growth:
- Stream 1: 2 viewers → Stream 100: 30 viewers → Stream 200: 60 viewers
- Algorithm rewards consistency
- Viewers develop routine
- Each stream builds on previous

### Proven "Tricks of the Trade"

#### Pre-Stream (1-3 hours before)
- 📱 Social media teasing with specific goals
- 💬 Discord notifications (automated)
- 🎨 Eye-catching thumbnail (face + bright colors)
- ⏰ "Countdown" starting soon screen

**Effectiveness:** 15-25% boost in initial viewers

#### During Stream

**The "2-Minute Rule"**
New viewers must understand context within 2 minutes:
- Regular recaps ("For anyone joining, we're building X...")
- Visible context (on-screen task list, project name)
- Welcoming atmosphere
- Don't assume prior knowledge

**The "Engagement Loop"**
- Read every chat message aloud
- Ask for opinions: "Should this be faster or stronger?"
- Implement suggestions when appropriate
- Create investment through participation

**The "Transparent Progress" Method**
Make goals visible and trackable:
```
Today's Goals:
☐ Implement collision detection
☐ Add particle effects
☐ Test enemy AI
☑ Fix player movement bug
```

**Result:** Viewers feel progress, increases satisfaction and retention

#### Post-Stream (Within 1 hour)

**The "Immediate Highlight Creation"**
- Create 60-second clip of best moment
- Post to TikTok, YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels, Twitter
- Include CTA: "Full stream on [platform]"

**Effectiveness:** Can drive 50-100+ new viewers to next stream

**The "VOD Optimization"**
- Detailed title with keywords
- Timestamp key moments
- Comprehensive description
- Relevant tags

**Result:** VODs become long-term discovery tools
