### Platform Economics

**Revenue Models Comparison:**

| Platform | Creator Split | Barrier to Entry | Best For |
|----------|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Kick | 95/5 | Very Low | New streamers seeking fast monetization |
| YouTube | 70/30 | High (1K subs, 4K watch hours) | Educational content, long-term SEO value |
| Twitch | 50/50 (70/30 elite) | Medium (50 followers, 3 CCV) | Gaming community, live interaction |
| Facebook | Variable | Medium | Casual content, older demographics |
| TikTok | Low direct | Medium-High | Discovery, traffic driver only |

**Recommended Strategy for MonoGame Streaming:**
- **Primary:** YouTube Live (long-term VOD value, educational content strength)
- **Secondary:** TikTok/Shorts (discovery engine, viral potential)
- **Tertiary:** Twitch (1x/week for community building)

**Revenue Potential:**
- **Year 1:** $0-500/month (building foundation)
- **Year 2:** $1,000-3,000/month (establishing authority)
- **Year 3+:** $2,000-8,000/month (diversified income streams)

### Content Strategy

**Optimal Format Mix:**
- **40%** Short-form clips (discovery, 60-second tips/highlights)
- **30%** Live streams (community building, 3x/week, 3 hours each)
- **20%** Hybrid tutorials (10-15 minute focused content)
- **10%** Long-form comprehensive guides (monthly deep-dives)

**Content Repurposing Efficiency:**
One 3-hour stream generates:
- 1 full VOD (YouTube/Twitch)
- 1-2 edited tutorials (15-20 min)
- 8-10 short clips (60 sec each)
- 1 blog post equivalent
- 20+ social media posts

**ROI by Format:**
- Short-form: 10,000 views/production hour (high discovery, low revenue)
- Hybrid: 400 views/production hour (balanced)
- Long-form: 100 views/production hour (low reach, high revenue)
- Live streaming: 50 concurrent viewers/production hour (best monetization)
