## Practical Tools and Techniques

### 1. Thought Records (CBT Tool)

**Situation** → **Automatic Thought** → **Emotion** → **Evidence For/Against** → **Alternative Thought** → **Outcome**

Example:
- **Situation**: Friend doesn't respond to text
- **Automatic Thought**: "They hate me, I'm worthless"
- **Emotion**: Sad, anxious (8/10)
- **Evidence For**: They didn't respond
- **Evidence Against**: They're usually responsive, might be busy, have been good friends for years
- **Alternative**: "They're probably busy. If there's an issue, they'll let me know"
- **Outcome**: Sad, anxious (3/10)

### 2. Behavioral Activation Planning

Create a weekly schedule that includes:
- **Necessary activities**: Work, appointments, basic self-care
- **Pleasurable activities**: Things you enjoy (even if depression says you won't)
- **Mastery activities**: Things that give sense of accomplishment
- **Social activities**: Connection with others
- **Physical activities**: Movement and exercise

**Tips**:
- Start small (5-10 minutes of activity)
- Schedule activities for times when energy is highest
- Don't wait to "feel like it" - action often precedes motivation
- Track completion and mood impact

### 3. Grounding Techniques (5-4-3-2-1)

When feeling overwhelmed or dissociated:
- Name **5 things** you can see
- Name **4 things** you can touch
- Name **3 things** you can hear
- Name **2 things** you can smell
- Name **1 thing** you can taste

### 4. Progressive Muscle Relaxation

Systematically tense and release muscle groups:
1. Hands and forearms (10 seconds tense, 20 seconds release)
2. Upper arms
3. Shoulders
4. Neck
5. Face
6. Chest and back
7. Stomach
8. Hips and buttocks
9. Thighs
10. Lower legs
11. Feet

### 5. Values Clarification Exercise

Identify what truly matters to you across life domains:

- **Family/Relationships**: What kind of partner, family member, friend do you want to be?
- **Career/Education**: What work matters to you? What do you want to contribute?
- **Personal Growth**: What skills or qualities do you want to develop?
- **Leisure**: How do you want to enjoy life?
- **Health**: How do you want to care for your body and mind?
- **Community**: How do you want to contribute to others?

Then: Rate how consistently you're living according to each value (1-10) and identify small actions aligned with your top values.

## Work-Specific Strategies

### Unemployment Coping Plan

**Structure Creation**:
- Set "work hours" for job searching (e.g., 9am-12pm)
- Create a daily schedule similar to employed life
- Dress as if going to work
- Designate a workspace at home

**Activity Diversification**:
- Volunteer work (2-4 hours weekly)

- Hobbies or creative projects
- Physical exercise routine

**Social Connection**:
- Join job seeker support groups
- Attend industry networking events

- Participate in community activities

**Mental Health Protection**:
- Separate self-worth from employment status
- Celebrate small wins (applications sent, skills learned)
- Set boundaries around job search (avoid 24/7 searching)
- Practice self-compassion
- Reframe as "in transition" rather than "unemployed"

### Managing Work Stress

**Boundary Setting**:
- Define work hours and stick to them
- Create email/notification schedules
- Learn to say "no" to non-essential tasks
- Take full lunch breaks away from desk

**Stress Response Plans**:
- 5-minute resets: Deep breathing, short walk, stretching
- Use breaks strategically: Not for more work
- End-of-day ritual: Clear transition between work and personal time
- Weekly review: What went well, what needs adjustment

**Advocacy**:
- Document workload if excessive
- Communicate with supervisor about capacity
- Request reasonable accommodations if needed
- Connect with HR about stress management resources

**Exit Strategies** (when environment is toxic):
- Update resume while still employed
- Network within industry
- Financial planning for transition

## Family-Related Depression Management

### Boundary Setting with Family

**Types of Boundaries**:
- **Physical**: Personal space, living arrangements
- **Emotional**: Not taking on others' feelings, limiting emotional labor
- **Time**: How much time spent with family members
- **Communication**: Topics off-limits, frequency of contact
- **Financial**: Money lending, shared expenses

**Implementing Boundaries**:
1. Identify what's needed: "I need..."
2. Communicate clearly: "I will/won't be able to..."
3. Stay consistent: Follow through even when challenged
4. Manage guilt: Boundaries are healthy, not selfish
5. Seek support: Therapist or support group

### Dealing with Difficult Family Members

**Strategies**:
- **Gray rock method**: Minimize emotional reactions, be boring/uninteresting
- **Limited contact**: Reduce frequency of interactions
- **Planned responses**: Prepare for common triggers
- **Support person**: Have someone aware who can help
- **Exit strategies**: Have excuse to leave early if needed

### Caregiving While Depressed

If caring for family members while managing depression:
- **Respite care**: Regular breaks from caregiving
- **Support groups**: Caregiver-specific groups
- **Task delegation**: Accept help from others
- **Simplify**: Lower standards where possible
- **Professional help**: Therapy focused on caregiver stress
- **Self-care non-negotiable**: Treat as essential, not optional

## Fatigue-Specific Strategies

### Chronic Fatigue and Depression Cycle

The connection:
- Depression causes fatigue
- Fatigue worsens depression
- Both create inactivity
- Inactivity worsens both

**Breaking the cycle**:
1. **Rule out medical causes**: Thyroid, anemia, vitamin deficiencies, sleep disorders
2. **Pacing**: Don't push through exhaustion
3. **Activity prioritization**: Energy budget for what matters most
4. **Rest quality**: Not just quantity
5. **Gradual increase**: Build tolerance slowly

### Energy Management Strategies

**Spoon Theory Application**:
- Count "spoons" (energy units) available daily
- Assign spoon cost to activities
- Plan days according to available spoons
- Don't borrow from tomorrow's spoons

**Energy Banking**:
- Rest before activities, not just after
- Build in recovery time after high-energy events
- Identify activities that restore vs. deplete energy
- Schedule restorative activities regularly

**Activity Modification**:
- Break tasks into smaller chunks
- Use tools/equipment to reduce physical effort
- Alternate demanding and easy tasks
- Sit when possible (prep food, fold laundry, etc.)

### Sleep Hygiene Specifics

**Sleep Schedule**:
- Same bedtime and wake time daily (even weekends)
- 7-9 hours opportunity for sleep
- No naps after 3pm
- Naps limited to 20-30 minutes if needed

**Bedroom Environment**:
- Cool temperature (60-67°F)
- Dark (blackout curtains or eye mask)
- Quiet (white noise if needed)

**Pre-Sleep Routine**:
- 30-60 minutes wind-down time
- Dim lights in evening
- Avoid screens 1 hour before bed (or use blue light filters)
- No caffeine after 2pm
- No alcohol within 3 hours of bedtime
- Light stretching or meditation
- Reading, journaling, or calm music

**If Can't Sleep**:
- Don't lie awake more than 20 minutes
- Get up and do quiet activity in dim light
- Return to bed only when sleepy
- Don't watch clock
- Avoid problem-solving or planning

## Support Network Building

### Creating Your Support Team

**Identify Current Network**:
