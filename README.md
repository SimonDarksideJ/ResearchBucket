## Suspicious contact evaluation (berrybrian347 [at] gmail [dot] com, assessed 2025-12-14)

*Purpose: logged as a project-specific incident record for traceability; contact address is obfuscated to reduce exposure while retaining attribution.*

- **Summary of claim:** An unsolicited email from “Brian” offering collaboration for a developer with 5+ years experience and C1 English.
- **Source validation:** The message originates from the generic Gmail address above with no company attribution, website, or verifiable identity. This prevents confirming the sender’s legitimacy or intent.
- **Reported activity:** No trustworthy public reports or internal references found across available OSINT (public search, security forums) or local records. Treat the address as unverified.
- **Risk indicators:**
  - Generic mass-recruitment wording without role, scope, or contracting entity.
  - Personal Gmail account instead of a corporate domain.
  - No portfolio, LinkedIn, or business details provided to authenticate the sender.
- **Recommended actions:**
  - Do not share personal or project information until the sender provides verifiable company details (legal entity, website, role description, and contract terms).
  - Request an official-domain email and signed NDA/statement of work before further discussion.
  - If unwanted, mark as spam and block the address; escalate as phishing only if additional malicious indicators appear.
