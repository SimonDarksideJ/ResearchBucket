# Paystream Principal Developer — critical assessment

## What the role is really asking for
- **Senior hands-on architect/lead**: joint owner of technical direction with the Tech Lead; designs solutions, sets standards, unblocks complex issues.
- **Modernisation driver**: migrate/reshape legacy estates toward .NET 8, Azure, microservices, CI/CD, automated testing, observability.
- **Coding mentor**: still shipping production C#/.NET code, pairing, reviewing, lifting team skills; no line management but strong influence.
- **Delivery partner**: translates architecture into executable plans, balances pragmatism vs. long-term sustainability, owns outcomes on key projects.

## Gaps & questions to clarify
- **Architecture target state**: current legacy footprint, decomposition roadmap, key systems to retire/replace, boundaries for microservices, eventing strategy.
- **Definition of “ownership”**: decision rights vs. Tech Lead, product constraints, budget for tooling/cloud, runway for tech debt paydown.
- **Quality expectations**: current test coverage, preferred testing approach (contract/integration/UI), non-functional SLOs, on-call/incident posture.
- **Delivery model**: team topology (squads? platform team?), release cadence, usage of Azure DevOps/TFS coexistence, SDLC checkpoints.
- **Security & compliance**: data protection expectations given financial domain, pen test cadence, secure-by-design requirements.
- **Career path**: progression beyond Principal (Staff/Architect), recognition for technical leadership vs. people management.
- **Hybrid pattern specifics**: flexibility on 2 days per week in Altrincham, travel support, core hours.

## Market comparison & salary validation (Manchester/Cheshire, Principal-level)
- **Typical responsibilities** align with Principal/Staff Engineer roles elsewhere: architectural leadership, mentorship, hands-on delivery.
- **Salary**: Principal/Staff C# roles in North West typically advertise **£85–100k** base (occasionally £105k with equity/bonus). £80k is competitive for upper-Senior/low-Principal, but may be **5–15% below** strong Principal market; leverage hybrid stability and benefits when negotiating.
- **Benefits**: holiday uplift, study leave, professional qualification budget are positive; clarify bonus, private healthcare, L&D allowance, and pension rate (currently “standard”).

## Personality/behavioural fit
- Collaborative influencer over authoritarian leader; comfortable mentoring and pairing.
- Pragmatic moderniser: can iterate within constraints, avoiding “big bang” rewrites.
- Ownership mindset: proactive risk removal, reliable delivery, calm under ambiguity.
- Curiosity and coaching orientation; champions testing/observability as cultural norms.

## Company snapshot (PayStream)
- UK fintech/umbrella payroll provider handling sensitive payments and data. Holds “Great Place to Work” accreditation and industry awards.
- Currently re-investing in platform modernisation. Emphasis on Azure, microservices, automation, and security hardening is implied.
- Public domain signals a **stable, regulated, service-oriented business**. Due diligence should confirm financial health (Companies House), regulatory posture, and incident history.
- Culture indicators to verify: autonomy granted to engineering, appetite for change vs. compliance constraints, and how “Great Place to Work” feedback aligns with engineering experience.

## Public offerings & modernisation signals (from public site/role spec)
- Publicly listed offerings remain payroll/umbrella, accounting, and tax services for contractors and agencies; online assets show calculators, portals, and compliance-focused content but no explicit AI/ML-enabled features or data products.
- Stated “technical transformation” focuses on .NET/Azure/microservices/CI-CD uplift; no published AI/ML roadmap, applied data/analytics strategy, or customer-facing automation beyond workflow digitisation.
- Opportunity areas: identity/fraud risk controls with anomaly detection, smarter expense/claims automation, conversational support for contractors/agencies, pricing/retention analytics, and document understanding for onboarding/compliance.
- Clarify whether data foundations (governance, MDM, event streams, telemetry lake) are in place to support future AI/analytics; absence of this in public signals suggests a gap.
- Ask for any board-level or regulatory constraints on AI usage (GDPR, fairness, model risk) and whether budget/time is earmarked for AI experimentation in the modernisation program.

## Customer sentiment & competitive positioning (public signals to probe)
- Public-facing materials do not publish NPS/CSAT or a “consumer index”; review Trustpilot/Google/industry forums for themes on support responsiveness, payslip accuracy, portal usability (desktop/mobile), and fee transparency.
- Scan app store/portal reviews (if applicable) for stability/performance complaints and backlog of unresolved issues; ask for cadence of release notes and how feedback is triaged.
- Compare to peer umbrella/payroll providers (e.g., Brookson/Parasol/Danbro cohort) that market mobile-first self-service, proactive compliance alerts, and analytics dashboards; PayStream’s public site stresses compliance/service but little on insight/automation differentiators.
- Ask how customer feedback is gathered (surveys, embedded analytics, A/B tests), how often SLAs are missed, and time-to-fix for production defects; request examples of issues raised publicly that were addressed and their turnaround.
- Look for indications they prioritise long-term service quality over margin optimisation: investment in support tooling, observability, incident communication, and transparent roadmap updates.

## Due diligence / open items before accepting
- Validate **roadmap and funding** for multi-year modernisation; confirm protected engineering time for refactoring and testing.
- Ask for **recent post-incident review** or reliability metrics (uptime, latency, change fail rate) and on-call expectations.
- Clarify **data classification and security** controls (PII handling, encryption standards, threat modelling).
- Request examples of **tech debt paydown** completed in the last 6–12 months and how success is measured.
- Understand **hiring plan** and how a Principal partners with product, architecture, and DevOps/platform teams.
- Discuss **promotion and review cycles**, budget authority, and freedom to introduce new technologies/tooling.
