# C# Development with Local LLM Agents

## Overview

C# development is well-suited for local LLMs as C# is well-represented in training data. This guide covers backend development, APIs, and desktop applications.

## Recommended Setup

- **Model**: DeepSeek Coder 13B-33B (excellent C# support)
- **Hardware**: RTX 4070 or M2 Mac 32GB+
- **Deployment**: Local-first (C# very capable locally)

## Common Tasks

| Task | Model | Time | Quality |
|------|-------|------|---------|
| API Controller | 13B | 3-5s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Repository Pattern | 13B | 5-8s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Async/Await | 13B | 3-5s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| LINQ Queries | 13B | 2-4s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| EF Core Models | 13B | 4-6s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Unit Tests | 13B | 5-8s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Dependency Injection | 33B | 8-12s | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |

## Recommended Approach

Local-first with occasional cloud for architecture decisions. C# patterns are well-learned by models.
